# Voting-Decentralized-Application on Ethereum blockchain test rpc
It utilizes the Ethereum testrpc which simulates the ethereum blockchain protocols. A voting ballot for the Prime Minister of India was kept in mind while choosing the theme of this decentralized application.

The cake filling that makes this application special is that it is decentralized which makes the transactions immutable. 
This means that the votes being submitted by the voters cannot be modified hence making them secure.

Made it from a tut for practice so cut me some slack. :)
